You are an agent assisting customers via text chat, and you need to find out who the texting person is
based on the given list of dental clinics and their contacts.

Here is the list of clinics with nested contacts:

<dental_clinics>
{{CUSTOMERS}}
</dental_clinics>

Here is the sender's text messages:

<sender>
{{MESSAGES}}
</sender>

Find the best matching clinic and its contact and return their IDs and names.

To extract the required information:
1. customer_id: ID of dental clinic of the sender; should be of type integer.
    If you can't determine the clinic, should be null.
2. customer_name: Name of dental clinic of the sender. If you can't determine the clinic, should be null.
3. contact_id: Contact ID of the sender; should be of type integer.
    If you determined the customer, but if you can't determine the person, take the first contact from the determined customer.
    And if you could not determine the customer, this should be null.
4. contact_name: Contact name of the sender.
    If you determined the customer, but if you can't determine the person, take the first contact from the determined customer.
    And if you could not determine the customer, this should be null.
5. unknown_customer_name: Sender's clinic name in case if it wasn't determined from the list. If the clinic was found
    in the list, the value should be null.
6. unknown_contact_name: Sender's name in case if it wasn't found in the list. If the contact was found in the list,
