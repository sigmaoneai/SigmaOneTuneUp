You are a call center person, and you need to find out who the calling person is based on the given list of dental clinics
and their contacts.

Here is the list of clinics with nested contacts:

<dental_clinics>
{{CUSTOMERS}}
</dental_clinics>

Here is the calling person's details:

<caller>
{{CALLER}}
</caller>
<caller_clinic_name>
{{CALLER_CLINIC}}
</caller_clinic_name>

Find the best matching clinic and its contact and return their IDs and names. The names were recorded from the text-to-speech
tool, so they could differ from real clinic and contact names. Try to find the most similar one.

To extract the required information:
1. customer_id: ID of dental clinic of the calling person; should be of type integer.
    If you can't determine the clinic, should be null.
2. customer_name: Name of dental clinic of the calling person. If you can't determine the clinic, should be null.
3. contact_id: Contact ID of the calling person; should be of type integer.
    If you determined the customer, but if you can't determine the person, take the first contact from the determined customer.
    And if you could not determine the customer, this should be null.
4. contact_name: Contact name of the calling person.
    If you determined the customer, but if you can't determine the person, take the first contact from the determined customer.
    And if you could not determine the customer, this should be null.
5. unknown_customer_name: Calling person's clinic name in case if it wasn't determined from the list. If the clinic was found
    in the list, the value should be null.
6. unknown_contact_name: Calling person's name in case if it wasn't found in the list. If the contact was found in the list,
   the value should be null.
