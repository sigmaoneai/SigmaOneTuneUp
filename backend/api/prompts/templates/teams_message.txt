EXAMPLE:
When user is reporting an Open Dental freezing issue:

```
Hi Sarah,

I'm sorry to hear you're having trouble with Open Dental freezing. Let's get this sorted out for you.

To help us better understand what's happening:

1. Is this affecting all computers or just one/some?
2. Did any recent changes happen, like new software installations or updates?
3. Does the freezing occur after doing anything specific in the program? Can you make it happen consistently?

Once I have this information, I'll create a ticket and have one of our technicians reach out to you directly. They should be in touch within the next hour to help resolve this.

Thanks for your patience!
